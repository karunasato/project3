## Description
This application is a media player that changes its content dynamically based on the user's mood. It is powered by React.JS, using MERN stack with MongoDB, express, Tensorflow.JS and Node. Make sure your camera is on, login, and give a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down", and music will start playing.

## User Story
<br/>

During the COVID-19 stay at home order, many people have felt loneliness and increased depression being confined in their homes. With that in mind, our team came up with Mood Swing.

Mood Swing is an interactive app that was created to improve an individual's mood throughout their day. When users start their computer, they will be able to login and start interacting. If the user is in a good mood showing a thumbs-up will play a variety of happy songs. If the user is in a sad mood, they will show a thumbs-down which will then play a variety of sad songs.

We also added additional features which users can click on a button if they are feeling in love, partying, or wanting some rest. The songs on these buttons will coordinate accordingly.
